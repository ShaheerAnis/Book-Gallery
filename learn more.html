        <i> Most of the libraries in the world are following the decimal classification system invented by Melvin Dewey and it is known as DDC, Dewey Decimal Classification System. It has a numerical part and alphabetical part. The numerical part is the class number assigned to each subject and the alphabetical part denotes the first 3 letters of the name of the author. The numbers range from 000 to 900 and there is a decimal symbol after every 3 digits for example 658.404 is the number for project management. All basic classes are 000 for general,100 for philosophy, 200 for religion, 300 for social sciences, 400 for languages, 500 for science ,600 for technology, 700 for the arts, 800 for literature and 900 for the history. All the knowledge divisions have unique number extended by decimals and the arrangement is in the ascending order.</i>
